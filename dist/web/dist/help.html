  <h1>TriflicScript Web Interpreter Help</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  This is a web-based interpreter for TriflicScript. This page contains guidance on the use of said web interpreter; for
  information surrounding TriflicScript, please <a href="https://github.com/triflicacid/triflic-script">view the
    repository on GitHub</a>.

  <h2>Layout</h2>
  The layout of the interpreter is kept relatively simple: STDIN is the Standard Input, where input to be interpreted is
  entered. After this is interpreted and executed by the TriflicScript runspace, any output will be directed into
  STDOUT.

  Below each input box are some additional settings, which will be covered below.

  <h3>STDIN</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Execute</strong> -- this will feed the content of STDIN into the TriflicScript runspace to be
      interpreted. This is keyboard-bound to <kbd>Ctrl + Enter</kbd>;</li>
    <li><strong>Upload File</strong> -- this will open a prompt to select a file, whose content will be read and
      interpeted;</li>
    <li><strong>Clear</strong> -- this will clear STDIN;</li>
    <li><strong>Time Execution</strong> -- if enabled, code parsing and execution will be timed. These statistics will
      be displayed in STDOUT below the expected output;</li>
    <li><strong>Last Command</strong> -- populated STDIN with the previously entered content in history. Bound to
      <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>;
    </li>
    <li><strong>Next Command</strong> -- populated STDIN with the next entered content in history. Bound to
      <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd>;
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>STDOUT</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Clear</strong> -- this will clear STDOUT;</li>
    <li><strong>Download</strong> -- this will download the current contents of STDOUT into a text file;</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Restrictions</h2>
  As this is a web-based interpreted, there are several restrictions places on the runspace. Most notable is the
  disability of accessing system information, restrictions to code importing via <code>import()</code>, etc...
